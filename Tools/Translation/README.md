# Use "Automated Translation" feature

## Intro
Remove all text files from the folder to start from scratch. None should exist by default, and will be created through each run.

## Translate.py
Pass in two parameters to this file:
 - name: Name of the output file containing the translations
 - text: String of text that you wish to be translated

### Language options
You can comment and uncomment the various languages which you want to use. They are sorted by unofficial categorizations, based solely on my understanding, which is admittely limited.

A list is created, which is then iterated through in order to generate the output file.

## families.py
This file contains the unofficial language designations I gave to each language, for the purpose of grouping.
